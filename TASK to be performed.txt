PART a 
Find invoics having more than one "entered" events. Remove all events for these invoices from customer_invoices file and record their IDs

PART b
For events with higher invoice version should have a status_datetime >= than the previous ones. Remove events for these invoices that fail this condition from customer_invoice and record their IDs.

PART c
Filter out the adjusted events from the remaining customer_invoices as we wont need them for this exercise

PART d
SANITY CHECK: find the 1st and last dates for all datetime fileds. Record them and check them if they are sensible
